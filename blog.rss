            <description>A while ago a new Komodo addon was submitted that seeks to make time tracking easier simply by using your editor activity as a means of tracking your time, allowing you to just do what you normally do without having to worry about manually starting or stopping some meter.</description>

            <description>Learning a new editor can be a daunting task, and it is a task that I faced in May 2013 when I switched to Komodo (briefly to Edit and then to IDE) after a 7 year history with my previous editor. After becoming familiar with the Komodo interface and keyboard shortcuts, I quickly began looking for other ways to boost my productivity.</description>

            <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2014 05:00:00 -07:00</pubDate>
            <description>Today we finally launched kopy.io after having had it in soft-launch for about 2 weeks. kopy.io is a new &#34;service&#34; for Komodo. Essentially it is a pastebin alternative with a bunch of little extras you likely wont find in other pastebin solutions.</description>

            <title>The History of Komodo, A Trip Down Memory Lane</title>

            <pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2014 05:00:00 -07:00</pubDate>
            <description>The first version of Komodo was released roughly 14 years ago. This means Komodo is older than some of its users.. and yet its held up remarkably well. Yes it was starting to show signs of aging, but Komodo 8 came with some age-reversing serum so this dragon isn't going anywhere.</description>

            <pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 06:00:00 -07:00</pubDate>
            <description>I like to use Komodo without any panes or tabs showing - just the editor. Normally I would use keybindings to toggle the relevant panes when I need them but I wanted something more intuitive; so I wrote a macro.</description>

            <description>Each day us programmers spend hours upon hours looking at our screen, and the main thing we look at is not our IDE, it's not our software or our browser; it's our code. So it's only natural that our code should be a pleasure to look at. One side of this is completely in your own hands; writing clean and sensible code. The other side slightly less so; the font you choose to represent your code.</description>

            <description>A Komodo customer recently asked for us to make adding image tags painless the way he was used to in his previous editor. Instead of typing some HTML and the URI, he wanted to pick the image file via a dialog box, and have Komodo do all the work. Well, I could file a bug, and he could then wait for the next development cycle to release a fix.</description>

            <description>The macro system in Komodo allows for some creative possibilities. I've written a macro that provides the ability to replay chess games, utilizing the Komodo editor to display the board, game pieces and sequence of moves: JavaScript macro source code here.</description>

            <description>We've been remiss in making screencasts for all the new features in Komodo IDE 7. To remedy that, Todd Whiteman has made this short video showing off Komodo Collaboration.</description>

This post shows how to take more control of the system and add your own syntax checkers.</description>

            <title>Syntax Checking Revisited in Komodo 7</title>

            <description>Komodo has always been adept at working with multiple languages. When we realized that multi-language templating systems were becoming more common, we made it easier to create new colorizers for them. But until now, Komodo wasn't very flexible at checking the syntax of these documents.</description>

            <description>We've been writing a fair bit about Stackato recently, but mostly with IT managers and sysadmins in mind. We thought it was time to evangelize a bit to the Komodo community. Since it's developers who will be the day-to-day users of this platform, we'd like to get you involved a bit more and hear your feedback.</description>

            <description>The plan for rolling out Komodo 7 is to bring on a wave of new functionality with each new alpha. This time the main difference is a revamp in the way we do as-you-type syntax checking.</description>

            <description>A couple of weeks ago we released Komodo IDE 7 Alpha 1 on an unsuspecting world. We want to get feedback on a couple of new features as early as possible so that we can incorporate the feedback in subsequent builds. In other words: things might break, and things will change, but it'll be fun.</description>
